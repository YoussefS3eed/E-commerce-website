# E‑Commerce Template – Bootstrap 5

This is a practice project Bootstrap 5 Design 02 – E‑Commerce Website

A modern, fully responsive **RTL** e‑commerce website template with a clean and professional design.

## 📌 About The Project

This template simulates a real‑world online store. It includes:

- **Sticky navbar** with brand logo, navigation links, dropdown, and shopping cart icon.
- **Full‑screen carousel** with custom indicators and captions.
- **Offcanvas shopping cart** – lists selected products with images, prices, and a total.
- **Product catalog** – cards with images, star ratings, titles, prices, and a modal for quick view.
- **Filter buttons** (all, bestseller, etc.) – ready for interactivity.
- **Contact section** with a call‑to‑action and subscription form.
- **Custom order form** – name, email, phone, message.
- **Bestselling products** – three columns showing most rated, most sold, and offers.
- **Service section** with Lottie animations and explanatory text.
- **Accordion** for return policy details.
- **Footer** with contact info and social links.

The design uses a clean color scheme with a primary blue (`#017dbf`) and crimson accents, and is fully **RTL‑compatible** (Arabic).
